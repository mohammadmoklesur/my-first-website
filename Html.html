           <p id="font-color22">Your primary task as a web developer will be to create reliable and high-performing web-based applications and services. Focusing solely on the underlying software and databases (known as the 'back end') is most common. However, some web developers work on the interface and visual design (the 'front end'), and others combine both ('full-stack development').</p>

          <div class="sadding-all"> <h1>Example</h1>
           <p id="font-color11">Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by Web development is the blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments for individual Web sites. The increased usage of open-source content management systems and enterprise content management systems has extended Web development's impact at online interaction and communication.</p>
